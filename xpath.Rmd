## Introduction

Let's visit the website [http://www.berkeley.edu/atoz](http://www.berkeley.edu/atoz)

How do we get all the links for the websites starting with __A__?

First let's inspect the source html code.

```{r}
# load XML
library(XML)

# parsing html content
doc <- htmlParse('http://www.berkeley.edu/atoz')
```

Let's begin by identifying the elements of the secondary navigation bar: `Map, Directory, bConnected, News`. To identify the corresponding node you can use the function `getNodeSet()`
```{r}
nav_node <- getNodeSet(
  doc = doc, 
  path = '//ul[@class="nav navbar-nav secondary-nav"]')

nav_node
```

You can be more specific and get just the list items __li__:
```{r}
navbar_nodes <- getNodeSet(
  doc = doc, 
  path = '//ul[@class="nav navbar-nav secondary-nav"]/li')

navbar_node
```

Now let's use `xpathSApply()` to retrieve the values for the elements in the secondary navigation bar:
```{r}
# secondary navigation
xpathSApply(
  doc = doc, 
  path = '//ul[@class="nav navbar-nav secondary-nav"]',
  fun = xmlValue)
```

Now let's get the __href__ links:
```{r}
# secondary navigation links
xpathSApply(
  doc = doc, 
  path = '//ul[@class="nav navbar-nav secondary-nav"]/li/a',
  fun = xmlAttrs)
```

__Your turn__: Get all the links for the sites starting with _A_
```{r}
# your code


```
